Implementation of the direct, inverse Kruskal and Prim algorithms, in such a way that software calculate the minimum spanning tree, by means of the methods in the graph class

def KruskalD(self):
def KruskalI(self):
def Prim(self):

The Main Graphs file, take the user through the random graphs creation and their respective minimum spanning tree
